Solution for this issue : Add the account for which you are using the APP id and have one developer certificate of the account with this certificate included. #RootCause# Because of previous instances in VMAppWithKonyLib, We got issue while generating iPA, once we delete the VMAppWithKonyLib in KonyiOSWorkspace issue will be resolved. Signing error is due to developer certificate for the Apple account which the App id used is not there in Keychain. "

Will they be affected ? 2) We have users reinstalling applications once in a while, will they fail to receive notifications as well. 3) Will users only miss the application side push notifications or also the \"App upgrade\", \"Device deregistered\" and other notifications pushed from the Kony product as well? 4) Will any configuration changes need to be made to fix issues if any for the Kony 6.5 version ? 5) In which parts of the infra would changes be required ?

			"solution1": " Please find the below answers for your queries. 1) We have push notifications in our applications. Will they be affected ? [Kony]: When Application consumes any latest dependencies of Google Play Services where GCM support is removed symbols may not be available either at compile time or run time. 2) We have users reinstalling applications once in a while, will they fail to receive notifications as well. [Kony]: The existing application will work as is if there are no changes in the application side. 3) Will users only miss the application side push notifications or also the \"App upgrade\", \"Device deregistered\" and other notifications pushed from the Kony product as well? [Kony]: There won't be any impact from Kony side. This change is from Google side not specific to Kony. 4) Will any configuration changes need to be made to fix issues if any for the Kony 6.5 version ? [Kony]: : FCM support is available from 8.x of Kony Visualizer. There is no fix from 6.5 version. Please note, 6.5 is already EOL and there won't be any further developments in this version. 5) In which parts of the infra would changes be required ? EMM, KMS servers, Application ? [Kony]: To get the complete support of FCM, you need to upgrade to latest 8.x version of all Visualizer, Mobile fabric along with EMM, KMS etc. 6) If any hotfix is required, how soon will you be able to provide the same, since we have only one week for the API deprecation ? [Kony]: As explained above, 6.5 is already EOL and there won't be any further developments in this version. To get the complete FCM support, please upgrade to latest version. Please find the attached document for more details on FCM migration. Kindly check and let us know if you need any further support. ",
			"solution2": " Please find the below answers for your queries. 1) We are using KMS server 6.5.0.2. for our push notifications - As we understand, if we do not update our application to get the latest Google Play services, will the application work fine still ? Based on the FAQ's, have the Google Play Support come back if they will support future play updates for GCM ? [Kony]: Yes as described in the document, if you are not consuming latest Google play services, your existing application will work as is. When Application consumes any latest dependencies of Google Play Services where GCM support is removed symbols may not be available either at compile time or run time. 2) Since the KMS server would be calling GCM, will it need to be upgraded to enable invoking FCM ? [Kony]: As per the Google standards, GCM is deprecated and you need to FCM in both Visualizer side as well as KMS side. In Kony studio 6.5, we don't have support for both Studio as well as KMS side for FCM. 3) In our application we are referring to google play service version like \"@integer/google_play_services_version\" - In this case, if the user updates the Google Play services app on his device, will it affect the application? [Kony]: Yes. This change will affect the application incase if any developer upgraded the Google play services from the sdk side. 4) We have an extended life support for our current Kony version. We would like to know how long will it take to provide the developed and tested hotfix for implementing the changes in our servers and what all servers would require the change. Either KMS alone, or EMM and other parts of the environment as well ? Based on your response we shall talk to the business here for the next step. [Kony]: We understand that you have EOL support for Kony studio 6.5 but there is no further development to support FCM in Kony Studio. ",

Please follow the below steps to consume the plugins. 3) Download the plugins from the shared FTP. 4) Close the Kony studio 6.5 and place the downloaded plugin in Konystudio/plugins folder. 5) Restart the Kony studio and check whether the EOL plugins are updated or not in the plugins screenshot 6) Please follow the steps which are present in the attached document. 7) Android 6.5 latest target support requires JAVA 1.8. Hence user needs to provide the JAVA Home path using steps below. 8) Create an ?androidBuildRequiredPaths.properties? file in the root folder of visualizer workspace. This is a common location for all 6.5 projects. 9) Add java 1.8 home as follows in the androidBuildRequiredPaths.properties file: installer.javahome=D:\\\\Java1.8\\\\jdk 10) Add java 1.8 home as follows in the androidbuild.properties file which is project specific. This property file takes precedence over androidBuildRequiredPaths.properties file properties. installer.javahome=D:\\\\Java1.8\\\\jdk 11) As explained the target version will not be available from the Kony studio. You can achieve through androidprecompiletask.xml 12) Create androidprecompiletask.xml file inside the project if not exists and add the below details. \u003cconcat destfile=\"${app.dir}/build.gradle\" append=\"true\"\u003e android { defaultConfig { targetSdkVersion 26 } } \u003c/concat\u003e 13) Save the file and refresh the workspace in Konystudio. 14) Build the application again.

			"solution1": " 1. Whether the up gradation is required? [Kony]: To get the complete FCM support in both Visualizer and KMS side, you need to go to Visualizer 8.2 and above versions. 2. If up gradation is required then is it patch process or complete installation? [Kony]: This is a complete installation not of hotfix plugins. Please download the 8.x version from https://community.kony.com/downloads URL and install it in your machines directly. 3. How long the existing GCM keys will work for android push notification [Kony]: As this is from Google and Google anounces the dates as below. As of April 10, 2018, Google has deprecated GCM. The GCM server and client APIs are deprecated and will be removed as soon as May 29, 2019. Migrate GCM apps to Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM), which inherits the reliable and scalable GCM infrastructure, plus many new features. See the migration guide to learn more. Please find the below documentation link for your reference. https://developers.google.com/cloud-messaging/faq 4. If we have to upgrade then will that be separate project or is part of support. [Kony]: You need to install the latest 8.x versions as a separate version in your machine and upgrade your project to that version. 5. What is the impact of migration of MF on all supported channels. [Kony]: There is no impact for the existing functionalities after moving to latest versions. We hope the above details helped you to resolve your queries.

The key, in this case, is an ID of a form in the application (just some context but not relevant) var keys = flow.keys(); for (var key of keys) { kony.application.destroyForm(key); } For loops like this must be rewritten in an older style such as below: for(var i = 0; i \u003c keys.length; i++) { kony.application.destroyForm(keys[i]); } Should Visualizer be converting these loops for IE? Here is a second example that IE will not validate: let uniqueAppealGroups = [...new Set(appealGroups)]; IE will not let you initialize an array like this. It has to be done like below instead. let uniqueAppealGroups = Array.from(appealGroups); The next example of JavaScript code that IE11 does not validate is the arrow operator: const grouped = this.groupBy(appealList, appeal =\u003e appeal.appealGroupId); There are likely other situations but these are the first ones I found. I have to fix them in order to find more. Is there an update or fix for Visualizer that will convert new style JavaScript into old style so IE 11 will see it as valid JavaScript code?

			"solution1": " As discussed, over the call, asked for the suggestion to add the FFI framework directly from visualiser instead adding them manually from Xcode as you have some network restriction to add / move it to Mac machine. So we have suggested a solution as follows: --\u003e Go to --\u003e Visualizer Edit --\u003e Manage custom Libraries --\u003e FFI window will open . Then include the respective third party framework along with FFI .h and .m files and re zip and upload them into the FFIs ZIP. Like wise we have to add them into the FFI zip itself and re generate the Mappings again, then third party frameworks will automatically into Xcode Libraries and frameworks section . with out any manually setting the frameworks too Xcode .

That is the reason you are seeing Last updated date as 28/4 without publishing the Helogics app. Note: Even if you upload any jars or link, until you dont publish it wont go the run time (UAT/Prod). Only after publish the jar and service artifacts get pushed to respective env. We suspect there was another app which had the jar and recently it was unpublished. Which may have resolved the issue.

Say, for row 1 of the first section, you asked for the cell, and made its image hidden. Now later when you scroll down, UITableView is smart enought to know that the cell is no longer used (as it's no longer visible on the screen), and it reuse the cell for new rows appearing down the view.

Build the attached iOS Kony sample application for google maps custom widget. Built using Kony visualizer 8 Service Pack 4 Fix Pack 16. 2. Follow the below steps to build the application successfully. Manually add the GooglePlaces framework to your project(KonyJS target) and configure your build settings in Xcode. Kindly refer the link(https://developers.google.com/places/ios-sdk/start#step-2-install-the-sdk) for more information. 1 Download the SDK source files: ? GooglePlaces-3.1.0 ? GoogleMaps-3.1.0 2 Unpack the source files. 3 Launch Xcode and either open an existing project, or create a new project. If you're new to iOS, create a Single View Application, and disable Use Storyboards and enable Use Automatic Reference Counting. 4 Remove any Maps bundles from previous releases from your project. 5 Drag the following bundles into your project (when prompted, select Copy items if needed): ? GooglePlaces-3.x.x/Frameworks/GooglePlaces.framework ? GoogleMaps-3.x.x/Base/Frameworks/GoogleMapsBase.framework 6 Right-click GooglePlaces.framework in your project, and select Show In Finder. 7 Drag the GooglePlaces.bundle from the Resources folder into your project. When prompted, ensure Copy items into destination group's folder is not selected. 8 Select your project from the Project Navigator, and choose your application's target. 9 Open the Build Phases tab, and within Link Binary with Libraries, add the following frameworks: ? GooglePlaces.framework ? GoogleMapsBase.framework ? Accelerate.framework ? CoreData.framework ? CoreGraphics.framework ? CoreImage.framework ? CoreLocation.framework ? CoreTelephony.framework ? CoreText.framework ? GLKit.framework ? ImageIO.framework ? libc++.tbd ? libz.tbd ? OpenGLES.framework ? QuartzCore.framework ? SystemConfiguration.framework ? UIKit.framework 10 Choose your project, rather than a specific target, and open the Build Settings tab. 11 In the Other Linker Flags section, add -ObjC. If these settings are not visible, change the filter in the Build Settings bar from Basic to All. 3. Comment the code statements in the file(CWICustomWebViewiOSUIWebViewProxy.m) as shown in screenshot 1. 4. Add the above frameworks in the KonyJS target. 5. In the Other Linker Flags section, add -ObjC(for the KonyJS target). If these settings are not visible, change the filter in the Build Settings bar from Basic to All. 6. Change the Deployment Target to 9.0(for the KonyJS target). Please find the attached screenshots for your reference.

Also try by setting the locale again after upding resource bundle ----- Team ensured that the issue is expected with the scenario/customization added in your application, as bundle is not refreshed with the new values by the time the form is loaded. ----- It is also suggested if you can write your own utility to directly update i18n file with the key values instead of updateresourcebundle API ----- But to debug further and if possible as the service is already available in your fabric, can you please test with sample to check if its an issue with Visualizer OR DBX flow which is delaying the process to udpate. ----- Also to unblock the current situation, please check if the menu and hamburger text is directly added under i18n window instead of getting from service as we believe that these menu and hamburger texts will not be changed in the application frequently.

So only one of the environments is working fine since only one certificate is being used to verify the signature of SAML response for all the different identity services(for each environment). This is resolved by changing the signing certificate for all those azure apps to use the same IDP certificate. We already have a bug open for the metadata issue and expected to release the fix in a couple of weeks. But currently, your client is not blocked anymore due to that.

So we configured the mail in our device i.e we added one of our account to the default mail application and then we run the application and clicked the mail and it is working fine. So you also please configure the mail account in your iphone device. Actually in your code you have to write the try - Catch block as mentioned in the documentation so that you will get the actually error to the catch block in case of such errors. Based on the error you display the popup to the client to enable the mail account. Else we won't know what is the actual error. you should write something like below. function openEmail() { try { var to=[\"abc@fgh.com\"]; var cc=[\"abc@abc.com\"]; var bcc = [\"xyz@xyz.com\"]; var sub = \"Hello\"; var msgbody = \"Testing openEmail\"; kony.phone.openEmail(to,cc,bcc,sub,msgbody,false,[]); } catch(err) { alert(\"error in opening Email:: \"+err); } } We hope this will solve your issue.

If we don't navigate to another form then the onEndEditing is not getting triggered. So The behaviour which is happening as of now is expected behaviour. So for your usecase, if you don't want to trigger the events inside onEndEditing then set a flag inside the timeout function so that the use case can be fulfilled when the flag is true then don't trigger events inside onEndEditing and if it's false then trigger events. This is the only way there we can handle the onEndEditing for the Timeout callback. Please check the same and let us know if you need any further clarifications regarding this. "

		"issue_response": {
			"solution1": ": As we remember you have raised 2 tickets. One of it is this issue and other is the project refresh issue for which i have already asked our internal team to clean the project and give it to you. Both these issues are interrelated. The reason for the project taking the long time to import is because of the \"Invalid objects present in the form\" which was coming to you when you refresh the project. So you have 2 ways to move forward here. #Approach1#: Wait for the response on other ticket(Project refesh error) where the team will clean the project and then will share the cleaned project to you and the issue will be resolved. #Approach2#: You can clean the project by yourselves by following the below steps. 1. First of all refresh the project and the visualizer will throw you the list of all the invalid objects present in various forms(In your project there are around 1200 such objects). copy that entire error list thrown and place it somewhere accessible. 2. Now identify all the forms that are referred in the entire list. 3. Now get to the latest fixpack (8.4.21 is latest as of now) 4. Now Whichever form is showing an error \"Invalid object found at....\". Open that form, change some property(any property of the form like \"Enable Idle timeout\") \u0026 Revert. Save the form. So that all the unsaved changes of the form will be saved and all the invalid objects of the form will be gone. 5. After all the forms are done with saving. Refresh the project to make sure that there are no more validation errors anymore. Now commit these changes to the repository so that your team will not face the issue again .Now try importing the project once again and you can see the project will be imported in less than 10 minutes. So at any time saving the changes will help out. So you can either wait for the response on other ticktet as mentioned in #Approach1 or you can follow the steps mentioned in #Approach2 As we have provided the root cause and solution(approaches) and as there is no further pending actions on the ticket, we are closing this ticket. If you face any other issues with kony products please feel free to create the ticket and we will help you out. "

With lazy loading concept, we are loading 20 records per scroll that mean in web DOM will be manipulated around 65 times(for 1300 records) while the scrolling browser may be stuck at this point and UI will get affected. To Maximize the performance, Please try to change the design, or use Pagination for smooth UI. If you follow the same design, You will face critical issues like app crash in the future when it is in production. Please update me in case of any issues. https://docs.kony.com/konylibrary/visualizer/app_design_dev/Default.htm#GuidelinesWhileUsingSegmentWidget.htm?Highlight=Segment In the above document, its clearly mentioned that Kony recommended using pagination whenever there is a use case to populate more than 20 records.

		"issue_response": {
			"solution1": " #Resolution Summary# As discussed with you this is purely native behaviour of browsers. Firefox and IE allow alphanumeric to be entered in input type = 'number' . And in all browsers note that both e and E are valid in numeric inputs(Even in chrome). Regarding Pattern Usage through code: \u003cinput type=\" number\"\u003e elements do not support the use of the pattern attribute for making entered values conform to a specific regex pattern. The rationale for this is that number inputs can't contain anything except numbers, and you can constrain the minimum and maximum number of valid digits using the min and max attributes Selecting a numeric input really does two things. First on mobile devices is should bring up a numeric keypad instead of a normal keyboard to enter input, second, it should only allow numbers as valid input. So if you want to prevent a user from entering text into one, you'll need JavaScript. Please check the sample HTML app provided for you Check the logic I had written in FilterInput function where the input goes red when the character(not the number) is entered(Firefox). ",

Since we are removing the NFI's comment the following lines of code in postapinit: registrationManager.setEventTracking(); At the moment, the only option to run the application in the simulator is to disable Jumio and UtilColors NFI and delete Barcode, ExceptionLogger, Signature FFI's.

Please refer below comments for more information. When an App is created on MF then unique App Key and App Secret values are autogenerated for that app. For all services that are created under this MF app the developer can choose between three security levels: 1) Protected: This service can only be accessed if the client has a valid MF token which is provided by identity after successful login. 2) Anonymous: This service can be accessed by a client even if it does not have a valid MF token but the client should provide the app key and app secret. 3) Public: This service can be accessed by any client without a valid MF token and without app key/app secret App Key and App Secret are embedded in the mobile app by Visualizer and this is automatically sent to MF by the app. MF uses this to identify the app in case of protected and anonymous services. We hope this resolves your queries. Please check and let us know in case if you have any further queries. ",
			"solution2": " We discussed internally with our security team and below are the detailed information on this. AppKey, AppSecret keys are not used for any encryption or decryption. These keys are used for identifying the mobile app for the communication between the mobile app and Mobile fabric. The app key / app secret is not used to encrypt data. It is only an identifier. It is just like an AppID in almost every modern client app built with or without Kony. Any client app starts a conversation with a backend service provider by sending some sort of client identifier. This is mostly for downloading any non-sensitive configuration and/or for logging/audit/analytics capture. The App Key is accessible because it is just an ID, but it is NOT used as a key for any kind of encryption and cannot be used outside the bounds of the app to access anything. Although it will be shown in release mode (protected or otherwise) it will not cause any security related issues for you. We hope this gives you a better understanding of these keys. "

		"issue_response": {
			"solution1": " Below are our observations and response on the reported issue and conveyed the same to Upendra yesterday evening over the call. 1. From today's conversation with Upendra, it is understood that the data is coming from service as below which you are assigning to rich text widget. \u003ca href=\\\"https://www.bankofjordan.com/page/security-tips\\\"\u003e \u003cfont color=\\\"#FFFFFF\\\" face=\\\"Cairo\\\"\u003e?????? ? ???????\u003c/font\u003e \u003c/a\u003e\\n\\n* ???? ??? ??????? ? ?????? ??? ??????? ??? ??? ?????? ? . ? . ? ( ????? ) ??? ???? ?? ????? ???????? ?????? ? / ?? ???????? ???? ?? ???? ??????? ?? ?????? ???????????, ????? ???? ?????? ??????? ??........\u003e 2. This was never working irrespective of XCode 9.x/10.x or any plugin 3. We confirmed that this is not related to RTL jar as RTL jar. For Ex: If the Arabic text is as below, text is displayed as it is but alignment will be from right but the text will not be converted. Attached screenshot for the same ??? ?????? ??? ??? ????????? ??????? ??? ?????? ?? ?? ???? ?? ?? ??? ?????? ??????? ???? ?????? ???????? ?? ?????? ?????? ?????? ??? ??????? ?? ??????? ??????? ?? ????? ?? ??????? ????? ??????? ?????? ?????? ????????? ??? ?? ?? ???? ??????? ???????? ???? ????? ?? ????? ?????? ?????? ?? ?? ??? ????. ????? ?? ?????? ???????? ?????? ??? ?????? ?? ????? ??? ??????? ???????? ??????? ??? ??????? ??????? ????????? ????? ?????? ???????????? ??????? ?? OR ??? ????? 4. But in this case, if you see the text above in step1, we can see that it is starting asterisk from left as \" * ???? ??? ??????? ? ?????? ??? ???????......\" and the expectation is that in Arabic locale it should start from right as \" \u003c\u003carabic text\u003e\u003e* \" 5. RTL jar just aligns the text from the right and the Arabic text should be in a correct format. But in this text, Arabic text itself is coming in a different way and RTL is just aligning the text from the right. 6. The content which is displayed in the rich text or Browser widget is taken care of by the Underlined OS/Browser Engine. So there is no action that visualizer is performing to display the content of the richText. Seems that you have already tried with browser widget using direction HTML property and it is working fine but as UI is different you are looking for other options to achieve with richTex. At the moment and as per my internal discussion with our product engineering team, we found that the only way to achieve your use-case is either by sending the Arabic text in the correct format so that text is just aligned from the right by RTL jar OR to us browser widget. Kindly validate all the above information and get back to us for any furthe queries. "

For example, Amazon, Flipkart login pages also display the same behaviors in their login pages. This is an expected behavior if the font-size is changed at system level. This is not seen in IOS devices because font-size change at system level affects only system apps but not uses apps. However, to overcome such behaviors, we suggest the following things 1. Follow Adaptive design. i.e., declare the layouts with respect to the highest system level font size. And use dp instead of other formats which is density independent and also use 'preferred' wherever possible 2. We have an article on basecamp which describes a solution, but an FFI has to be written for this. We are providing a link to this article here: https://basecamp.kony.com/s/article-detail/a046A00000AVTFxQAP/fix-the-font-size-regardless-the-system-settings Please follow the above details and let us know if you still need any further support.

			"solution1": " 1. Can we use these API to compress the image? - Yes, If you are getting any raw bytes from service you can create an image Object and compress that using the Image Object. 2. What is the difference between compress and scale APIs? - Image resizing/scaling means you're going to shorten the resolution of the image. suppose the user selects a 1000*1000 px image. you're going to convert the image into a 300*300 image. thus image size will be reduced. And Image compression is lowering the file size of the image without compromising the resolution. Of course, lowering file size will affect the quality of the image. There are many compression algorithms available which can reduce the file size without much affecting the image quality. 3. Kony has API to convert base64 to raw bytes?- Yes, you can use Kony.convertToRawBytes(base64String); check the link https://docs.kony.com/konylibrary/visualizer/viz_api_dev_guide/content/kony_functions.htm Update me for any queries I am happy to help you.

Here are the details on the issue: The error occurs on the init action of the form when we are redirecting through click action. It occurs for all the click actions in our app, which are used for redirecting to the forms. (for example., we have a footer component with four flex containers, on-click action of each flex container, it will redirect to some form. For now, on-click of that flex-containers, it shows error and the form is not shown up but the app is not crashing).",

When we completely opened the app it is showing actual page info which is visited earlier. But in case of android it is showing what ever the page user visited earlier as preview (in recent apps) when application is in background. Attached the screenshots for your reference. Description as per Kony security check list: -------------------------------------------- Snapshot Information Disclosure ( 'When an application transitions from the foreground to the background, the device takes a snapshot of the last window viewed within the application. This snapshot is then presented to the user while the application transitions from the background to the foreground. Although this offers a seamless user transition when switching between applications, it does present a security risk. Depending at which point the application is sent to the background, a snapshot may contain sensitive information such as usernames, passwords, credit card details, address information and so on, all of which would be stored in an unencrypted screenshot. ) Regards, Siva",

		"issue_description": "Hi Team, We are trying to replicate the pull down refresh feature in list views inside Flex scroll containers. But it seems like the pull down gesture for Flex scroll containers is available only in iOS and not in Android. We checked the android applications developed in KONY and native applications. In native android applications, for scroll containers, even though pull down refresh feature is not there, the scroll views will get pulled a little inwards as needed for pull down refresh scenario. But in KONY developed android applications, the scroll containers seems to get stopped scrolling at the top and does not allow us to pull the view a little downwards to get the gesture of pull down. Hope you understand the scenario. Please tell us if there is any way we can achieve the pull down gesture for scroll view widgets in KONY",

For more info please go through the doc link. https://docs.kony.com/konylibrary/visualizer/viz_widget_prog_guide/Default.htm#Segment_Events.htm If you want the same behavior for flexScrollContainer you can achieve this through code. By using contentOffsetMeasured property, we can implement the onreachend and onreachbegining. We can add records once onreachend / onreachbegining logic. Please find attached sample app for reference. https://docs.kony.com/konylibrary/visualizer/viz_widget_prog_guide/Content/FlexScrollContainer_Properties.htm Hope this answers your query if you still have any issue get back to us.

This is working fine for all the 64-bit devices irrespective of device OS version. But, the App is not installing in the devices which are with 32-bit configuration after this setting. Is there any additional setting needs to be done in Visualizer to get 32-bit \u0026 64-bit support.

For that, you want to pass the encrypted string instead of direct json with special chars. For this, you are using some mechanism to encode the input value and sent to middleware with Content-Type-\u003e text/plain. But, that is not encoding the \"+\" symbol and sending as it is. Due to the Content-Type-\u003e text/plain our middleware is removing \"+\" and adding space. To avoid that please use the \"encodeURIComponent\" method to encode the input param completely and then send it to middleware. I have tested this in Normal DesktopWeb and Windows Kiosk which is working as expected. Please find the js code what I have tested and the middleware.log from my local testing. "

		"issue_response": {
			"solution1": " Q: We are using kony.os.deviceInfo().identifierForVendor for iPhone and gets generated different value every time the application is re-installed. This is expected behavior in native iOS, if a user uninstalls the application from a vendor and then re-installs them, the identifierForVendor will be reset. Note: 1. The value in this property remains the same while the app (or another app from the same vendor) is installed on the iOS device. 2. The value changes when the user deletes all of that vendor?s apps from the device and subsequently reinstalls one or more of them. 3. The value can also change when installing test builds using Xcode or when installing an app on a device using ad-hoc distribution. 4. Therefore, if your app stores the value of this property anywhere, you should gracefully handle situations where the identifier changes. 5. The other thing to point out here is that if a user uninstalls all of the apps from a vendor and then re-installs them, the identifierForVendor will be reset. Kony documentation link: http://docs.kony.com/80beta/assets/visualizer/viz_api_dev_guide/content/kony.os_objects_deviceinfo.htm We request you to refer to a below helpful article on identifierForVendor - iOS https://basecamp.kony.com/s/article-detail/a046A00000AVPlUQAX/identifierforvendor-ios "

Hi Shibu, This issue is not with images provided, but the team is using some kind of intermediate form between splash and login where they use splash image as form background and hence there are technical challenges to resolve. Technically, Android supports 9-patch for Splash only and when we use the same image for intermediate screen as a form background, the image getting stretched because of multiple screen resolutions in different form factors such as HDPI, XHDPI, etc., I provided some solutioning to the team and it didn?t work.

What are the options we need to set in Kony VIz to create single APK with both 32 and 64 bit?. And this will generate both arm and x86? A. From 8.4.12 we are supporting Fat binary where you can create both 32 bit and 64 bit in singly APK so to do this you need to set the \"enable 64 bit \" to true in project settings and also create a file \"androidbuild.properties\" in workspace-\u003eYour project and add the following entry: support32bit - true and then you can generate a binary which supports both 32 bit and 64 bit. 3.

It is not a platform issue. The corresponding dev teams may have to look to into whether there are any code snippets where we are changing the images based on your requirements. 2. Code obfuscation issue - Inorder to get the code obfuscation, you have to build the app in protected mode. This will resolve the code obfuscation. 3. Tap jacking issue- we can take care of the tap jacking issue by writing a AndroidprecompileTask. Please follow the below steps. A) Go the git hub link https://github.com/Kony-CSE/Tapjacking/tree/master/ScriptsTobeCopiedInKonyProject B) Download the folder and file which were displayed over C) Go to your visualizer workspace/project and copy those folder and file over there.

Based on your documentation in this link: https://basecamp.kony.com/s/question/0D52K00003TttQ3/mandatory-64-bit-requirement-policy-for-android-applications-hosted-in-play-store We need to upload 2 APK. 1 is 32 bit and the other is 64 bit. Right now, we are upload using Android App Bundle, based on Google documentation (https://developer.android.com/google/play/publishing/multiple-apks), it said that \"If you publish your app to Google Play, you should build and upload an Android App Bundle. When you do so, Google Play automatically generates and serves optimized APKs for each user?s device configuration, so they download only the code and resources they need to run your app. Publishing multiple APKs is useful if you are not publishing to Google Play, but you must build, sign, and manage each APK yourself.\" from that message, it better using Android App Bundle. Right now I already can use that tools. but should I check properties \"Support 64 bit\" based on Your Documentation? Note we will upload soon, so i will raise with severity 1. Thank You",
		"issue_response": {
			"solution1": " You need to follow this manual approach for lower version of the visualizer. For older releases, you need o to follow the below steps. a) You would need to build the Kony application twice If you need to support x86 and x86_64 bit as well enable \"Support x86\" option in project properties. =\u003e Build 32 bit application without enabling \"Support 64-bit Devices\" option in project properties. =\u003e Build 64 bit application by enabling \"Support 64-bit Devices\" option in project properties. b) Merge the libs folder from both 32 and 64 bit Native android native projects, specifically, .so files and their architecture-specific folders. Make sure sub-dependent libraries contains all the required .so files for all supported architectures. The sub-dependent library sources could be .aar files, Gradle dependencies pulled from remote repositories and any other libraries with source locally added by making entries in settings.gradle c) Merge the build.gradles from both 32 and 64 bit Native android native projects importantly ndk { abiFilters } entries need to be merged from both build.gradle files* In POINT B you need to compare both the 32 bit and 64 bit builds and merge the .so files and lib files for making single binary(which will be used for app bundle). In POINT C you need to compare both the build.gradles from both 32 and 64 bit build and merge the entries which are required for both. especially check the \"abiFilters\" in that files. Please contact an android expert to understand the process of merging the files like .so and build.gradles files. Hope this answers your question. If you still have any issue please get back to us. "

For application running on APILevel\u003e=23 (Marshmallow) devices ANDROID_ID is returned as deviceID to get rid of acquiring READ_PHONE_STATE permission for device id from Telephony Manager.

OR, Use kony.os.createUUID UUID (Universally Unique Identifier) is a universally unique value that can be used to identify types, interfaces, and other items. This API returns a string that contains a formatted UUID value. For example, E621E1F8-C36C-495A-93FC-0C247A3E6E5F. Please refer the below document for more information. https://docs.kony.com/konylibrary/visualizer/viz_api_dev_guide/content/kony.os_functions.htm Please note that, If you are using the kony.os.createUUID then, save the UUID value using Local Storage API and if required do the encryption while stroing the values The reason behind this step, kony.os.createUUID will give another universally unique value if you call the same API again from the same device.

When you use FFIs with Kony Visualizer, if the FFI has dependencies on any system frameworks, you can add those system frameworks to your XCode project. You can do so by configuring a kony_frameworks.json file. To add system frameworks to the XCode project, do the following: 1. Navigate to the common folder in your Kony Visualizer project. For example, \u003cWorkspace Name\u003e/\u003cProject Name\u003e/resources/common 2. In the folder, create a JSON file and name it kony_frameworks.json. 3. Open the JSON file in any text editor. 4. Add a JSON object with the key as systemframeworks and value as an array containing all the system frameworks that are dependencies for FFI?s. For example, { \"systemframeworks\" : [\"AVFoundation\", ?Security?, ?LocalAuthentication?] } 5. In Kony Visualizer, build the app. The JSON file is incorporated into the KAR file. When the KAR file is extracted, system frameworks provided in the JSON is added to the XCode project. #Kony Doc Link# https://docs.kony.com/konylibrary/visualizer/visualizer_user_guide/Content/BuildAnAppForiOS.htm "

There update the code at \"Gradle Entries\" with the changes provided in simran system. 6. Add the \"androidprecomilertask\" file in your project work space. 7. update target version to 28. #Conclusion# 1. Here you need to update the plugin because of you have the issue with camera widget and Android 10. 2. After updating the plugin in visualizer you need to change your internal gradel versions what you are using in previous versions to latest visualizer plugin or else build will gets failed due to mismatch gradel versions between visualizer and application.

When a user attempts to view the Notification Center, a call goes out to the KPNS server (/kpns/api/v1/messages/fetch). From there, it appears that a call is made to the messageentry and messageentry_status table in the MySQL database. When looking at each table, there are 1.4 million records in each (we recently archived some data ? previously, it was over 2 million records). Is there anything that can be done to speed up the process to open up the Notification Center and to view a message detail?

Please find the below documentation link for your reference. https://docs.kony.com/konylibrary/visualizer/viz_api_dev_guide/content/kony.os_objects_deviceinfo.htm Also, as per Android Q docs, there is a behavioral change in Getting Non-resettable device identifiers (IMEI and serial number) Google Doc link: https://developer.android.com/preview/privacy/data-identifiers#device-ids and Kony is inline with the same. As per the DOC: Getting Non-resettable device identifiers will result in the following way: ? If your app targets Android Q, a SecurityException occurs. ? If your app targets Android 9 (API level 28) or lower, the method returns null or placeholder data if the app has the READ_PHONE_STATE permission. Otherwise, a SecurityException occurs. So, getDeviceID() is returning null for apps running on Android Q device.
