Based on the FAQ's, have the Google Play Support come back if they will support future play updates for GCM ? [Kony]: Yes as described in the document, if you are not consuming latest Google play services, your existing application will work as is. When Application consumes any latest dependencies of Google Play Services where GCM support is removed symbols may not be available either at compile time or run time. 2) Since the KMS server would be calling GCM, will it need to be upgraded to enable invoking FCM ? [Kony]: As per the Google standards, GCM is deprecated and you need to FCM in both Visualizer side as well as KMS side. In Kony studio 6.5, we don't have support for both Studio as well as KMS side for FCM. 3) In our application we are referring to google play service version like \"@integer/google_play_services_version\" - In this case, if the user updates the Google Play services app on his device, will it affect the application? [Kony]: Yes. This change will affect the application incase if any developer upgraded the Google play services from the sdk side. 4) We have an extended life support for our current Kony version. We would like to know how long will it take to provide the developed and tested hotfix for implementing the changes in our servers and what all servers would require the change. Either KMS alone, or EMM and other parts of the environment as well ? Based on your response we shall talk to the business here for the next step.

Please note, 6.5 is already EOL and there won't be any further developments in this version. 5) In which parts of the infra would changes be required ? EMM, KMS servers, Application ?

Please download the 8.x version from https://community.kony.com/downloads URL and install it in your machines directly. 3. How long the existing GCM keys will work for android push notification [Kony]: As this is from Google and Google anounces the dates as below. As of April 10, 2018, Google has deprecated GCM. The GCM server and client APIs are deprecated and will be removed as soon as May 29, 2019. Migrate GCM apps to Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM), which inherits the reliable and scalable GCM infrastructure, plus many new features. See the migration guide to learn more. Please find the below documentation link for your reference. https://developers.google.com/cloud-messaging/faq 4. If we have to upgrade then will that be separate project or is part of support. [Kony]: You need to install the latest 8.x versions as a separate version in your machine and upgrade your project to that version. 5. What is the impact of migration of MF on all supported channels. [Kony]: There is no impact for the existing functionalities after moving to latest versions. We hope the above details helped you to resolve your queries.

Now later when you scroll down, UITableView is smart enought to know that the cell is no longer used (as it's no longer visible on the screen), and it reuse the cell for new rows appearing down the view.

So only one of the environments is working fine since only one certificate is being used to verify the signature of SAML response for all the different identity services(for each environment). This is resolved by changing the signing certificate for all those azure apps to use the same IDP certificate.

Therefore it's best to just put some random string on the autocomplete section like: autocomplete=\"autocomplete_off_hack_xfr4!k\" That's why autcomplete=\"false\" accidentally works. Note that make sure the autocomplete value for each input is different. Hence the random string at the end. Or else you may get suggestions from fields with the same autocomplete value.

If we don't navigate to another form then the onEndEditing is not getting triggered. So The behaviour which is happening as of now is expected behaviour. So for your usecase, if you don't want to trigger the events inside onEndEditing then set a flag inside the timeout function so that the use case can be fulfilled when the flag is true then don't trigger events inside onEndEditing and if it's false then trigger events. This is the only way there we can handle the onEndEditing for the Timeout callback. Please check the same and let us know if you need any further clarifications regarding this. ",

				"Solution": ": As we remember you have raised 2 tickets. One of it is this issue and other is the project refresh issue for which i have already asked our internal team to clean the project and give it to you. Both these issues are interrelated. The reason for the project taking the long time to import is because of the \"Invalid objects present in the form\" which was coming to you when you refresh the project. So you have 2 ways to move forward here. #Approach1#: Wait for the response on other ticket(Project refesh error) where the team will clean the project and then will share the cleaned project to you and the issue will be resolved. #Approach2#: You can clean the project by yourselves by following the below steps. 1. First of all refresh the project and the visualizer will throw you the list of all the invalid objects present in various forms(In your project there are around 1200 such objects). copy that entire error list thrown and place it somewhere accessible. 2. Now identify all the forms that are referred in the entire list. 3. Now get to the latest fixpack (8.4.21 is latest as of now) 4. Now Whichever form is showing an error \"Invalid object found at....\". Open that form, change some property(any property of the form like \"Enable Idle timeout\") \u0026 Revert. Save the form. So that all the unsaved changes of the form will be saved and all the invalid objects of the form will be gone. 5. After all the forms are done with saving. Refresh the project to make sure that there are no more validation errors anymore. Now commit these changes to the repository so that your team will not face the issue again .Now try importing the project once again and you can see the project will be imported in less than 10 minutes. So at any time saving the changes will help out. So you can either wait for the response on other ticktet as mentioned in #Approach1 or you can follow the steps mentioned in #Approach2 As we have provided the root cause and solution(approaches) and as there is no further pending actions on the ticket, we are closing this ticket. If you face any other issues with kony products please feel free to create the ticket and we will help you out. ",

If you are able to run on the device and not on the simulator is because of NFI's and FFi's libraries, Jumio, Gemalto, UtilColors, Barcode, ExceptionLogger, Signature FFI's and other FFi's added as part of RB app. 2. We tried in many different ways in generating new NFI libraries to support on the simulator but Jumio is not working because of its dependency on other libraries which are not having support for the simulator. 3. Even if there are any FFi's that are used in the project and do not have support for the simulator, you see the issue. 4. As a workaround, we suggest you disable Jumio and UtilColors NFI and delete Barcode, ExceptionLogger, Signature FFI's. 5. Since we are removing the NFI's comment the following lines of code in postapinit: registrationManager.setEventTracking(); At the moment, the only option to run the application in the simulator is to disable Jumio and UtilColors NFI and delete Barcode, ExceptionLogger, Signature FFI's. Apart from these, if you see any other NFI or FFi throwing a similar error, you need to do the same for those.

When an App is created on MF then unique App Key and App Secret values are autogenerated for that app. For all services that are created under this MF app the developer can choose between three security levels: 1) Protected: This service can only be accessed if the client has a valid MF token which is provided by identity after successful login. 2) Anonymous: This service can be accessed by a client even if it does not have a valid MF token but the client should provide the app key and app secret. 3) Public: This service can be accessed by any client without a valid MF token and without app key/app secret App Key and App Secret are embedded in the mobile app by Visualizer and this is automatically sent to MF by the app. MF uses this to identify the app in case of protected and anonymous services.

These keys are used for identifying the mobile app for the communication between the mobile app and Mobile fabric. The app key / app secret is not used to encrypt data. It is only an identifier. It is just like an AppID in almost every modern client app built with or without Kony. Any client app starts a conversation with a backend service provider by sending some sort of client identifier. This is mostly for downloading any non-sensitive configuration and/or for logging/audit/analytics capture. The App Key is accessible because it is just an ID, but it is NOT used as a key for any kind of encryption and cannot be used outside the bounds of the app to access anything. Although it will be shown in release mode (protected or otherwise) it will not cause any security related issues for you. We hope this gives you a better understanding of these keys. ",

From today's conversation with Upendra, it is understood that the data is coming from service as below which you are assigning to rich text widget. \u003ca href=\\\"https://www.bankofjordan.com/page/security-tips\\\"\u003e \u003cfont color=\\\"#FFFFFF\\\" face=\\\"Cairo\\\"\u003e?????? ? ???????\u003c/font\u003e \u003c/a\u003e\\n\\n* ???? ??? ??????? ? ?????? ??? ??????? ??? ??? ?????? ? . ? . ? ( ????? ) ??? ???? ?? ????? ???????? ?????? ? / ?? ???????? ???? ?? ???? ??????? ?? ?????? ???????????, ????? ???? ?????? ??????? ??........\u003e 2. This was never working irrespective of XCode 9.x/10.x or any plugin 3. We confirmed that this is not related to RTL jar as RTL jar. For Ex: If the Arabic text is as below, text is displayed as it is but alignment will be from right but the text will not be converted. Attached screenshot for the same ??? ?????? ??? ??? ????????? ??????? ??? ?????? ?? ?? ???? ?? ?? ??? ?????? ??????? ???? ?????? ???????? ?? ?????? ?????? ?????? ??? ??????? ?? ??????? ??????? ?? ????? ?? ??????? ????? ??????? ?????? ?????? ????????? ??? ?? ?? ???? ??????? ???????? ???? ????? ?? ????? ?????? ?????? ?? ?? ??? ????. ????? ?? ?????? ???????? ?????? ??? ?????? ?? ????? ??? ??????? ???????? ??????? ??? ??????? ??????? ????????? ????? ?????? ???????????? ??????? ?? OR ??? ????? 4. But in this case, if you see the text above in step1, we can see that it is starting asterisk from left as \" * ???? ??? ??????? ? ?????? ??? ???????......\" and the expectation is that in Arabic locale it should start from right as \" \u003c\u003carabic text\u003e\u003e* \" 5. RTL jar just aligns the text from the right and the Arabic text should be in a correct format. But in this text, Arabic text itself is coming in a different way and RTL is just aligning the text from the right. 6. The content which is displayed in the rich text or Browser widget is taken care of by the Underlined OS/Browser Engine. So there is no action that visualizer is performing to display the content of the richText. Seems that you have already tried with browser widget using direction HTML property and it is working fine but as UI is different you are looking for other options to achieve with richTex. At the moment and as per my internal discussion with our product engineering team, we found that the only way to achieve your use-case is either by sending the Arabic text in the correct format so that text is just aligned from the right by RTL jar OR to us browser widget.

This is not seen in IOS devices because font-size change at system level affects only system apps but not uses apps. However, to overcome such behaviors, we suggest the following things 1. Follow Adaptive design. i.e., declare the layouts with respect to the highest system level font size. And use dp instead of other formats which is density independent and also use 'preferred' wherever possible 2. We have an article on basecamp which describes a solution, but an FFI has to be written for this.

What is the difference between compress and scale APIs? - Image resizing/scaling means you're going to shorten the resolution of the image. suppose the user selects a 1000*1000 px image. you're going to convert the image into a 300*300 image. thus image size will be reduced. And Image compression is lowering the file size of the image without compromising the resolution. Of course, lowering file size will affect the quality of the image. There are many compression algorithms available which can reduce the file size without much affecting the image quality. 3. Kony has API to convert base64 to raw bytes?- Yes, you can use Kony.convertToRawBytes(base64String); check the link https://docs.kony.com/konylibrary/visualizer/viz_api_dev_guide/content/kony_functions.htm Update me for any queries I am happy to help you.

				"Solution": " Q: We are using kony.os.deviceInfo().identifierForVendor for iPhone and gets generated different value every time the application is re-installed. This is expected behavior in native iOS, if a user uninstalls the application from a vendor and then re-installs them, the identifierForVendor will be reset. Note: 1. The value in this property remains the same while the app (or another app from the same vendor) is installed on the iOS device. 2. The value changes when the user deletes all of that vendor?s apps from the device and subsequently reinstalls one or more of them. 3. The value can also change when installing test builds using Xcode or when installing an app on a device using ad-hoc distribution. 4. Therefore, if your app stores the value of this property anywhere, you should gracefully handle situations where the identifier changes. 5. The other thing to point out here is that if a user uninstalls all of the apps from a vendor and then re-installs them, the identifierForVendor will be reset. Kony documentation link: http://docs.kony.com/80beta/assets/visualizer/viz_api_dev_guide/content/kony.os_objects_deviceinfo.htm We request you to refer to a below helpful article on identifierForVendor - iOS https://basecamp.kony.com/s/article-detail/a046A00000AVPlUQAX/identifierforvendor-ios ",

From 8.4.12 we are supporting Fat binary where you can create both 32 bit and 64 bit in singly APK so to do this you need to set the \"enable 64 bit \" to true in project settings and also create a file \"androidbuild.properties\" in workspace-\u003eYour project and add the following entry: support32bit - true and then you can generate a binary which supports both 32 bit and 64 bit. 3. What Kony suggests? --\u003e android app bundle(aab) --\u003e single apk with both 32 and 64 --\u003e separate 32 and 64 bit apks? A. The best suggested is option 3 and option 1. The reason to avoid option 2 is it generates the size of the APK larger. Please go through and let us know if you are having any other clarifications on top of this. ",

Make sure sub-dependent libraries contains all the required .so files for all supported architectures. The sub-dependent library sources could be .aar files, Gradle dependencies pulled from remote repositories and any other libraries with source locally added by making entries in settings.gradle c) Merge the build.gradles from both 32 and 64 bit Native android native projects importantly ndk { abiFilters } entries need to be merged from both build.gradle files* In POINT B you need to compare both the 32 bit and 64 bit builds and merge the .so files and lib files for making single binary(which will be used for app bundle). In POINT C you need to compare both the build.gradles from both 32 and 64 bit build and merge the entries which are required for both. especially check the \"abiFilters\" in that files.

				"Solution": " Please find the below answers for your queries. 1) How deviceid works in mobile web (both for Android and iOS devices) [Kony]: The deviceid is a random id, saved in localStorage. If we clear localStorage/browser cache, then a new random id gets generated. 2) How it works when we create it as PWA [Kony]: The same process with even PWA application as well. 3) For desktop web, Except clearing the cache does it always gives the same id? Will the id unique to that user? Other users in the internet won't get the same id [Kony]: Yes. If a user clears the cache, the next time the user launches the web app on the same device, the user is treated as unique. The deviceID value does not persist after cache cleanup.
